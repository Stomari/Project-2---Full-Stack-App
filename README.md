<h1>MusiKick</h1>
<h3>FullStack project by <a href="https://github.com/gabholanda">Gabriel Holanda</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Stomari">SÃ©rgio Tomari</a></h3>
<br>
<p>In this project we have challenge ourselfs to build a full stack web application that have all functionalities of a CRUD model, and apply the knowledge aquired in the second module of Ironhack. To do so, we planned a website for musicians and people who want to make bands, where you would easily find people with commom music taste and play different musical instruments.</p>
<br>
<p>As a member of our website you can request to join any band you would like to, and edit your profile as much as you want. If you peform well and become well knwon, people can vote on you and so you can appear on our ranking as our top 3 artists. Also, you can create bands and invite people who play specific instruments to join you. Our web application lets you become an editor too, so you can write the latest news and tips about the music universe.</p>

<p>We had little time to work on our front-end and there is some visual problems that we would like to correct in the future. For the back-end, we need to implement members being able to leave the band. We would also like to add social media login to the project and Google maps geolocation to help our users to find musicians near them.</p>
